## Welcome!

This is the start of my new blog where I'll be practicing GitHub pages site development, sharing my favorite photos that I've taken lately, and generally using as a place to muse on my life lately and what I've been watching, reading, and eating. I hope it's fun to read for anyone who encounters it!

For now this blog will be named "The Calegraph." If you used to read my sandwich blog, or are interested on my thoughts on sandwiches in DC, check out the link below. I'm sure there will be more sandwich talk here.
